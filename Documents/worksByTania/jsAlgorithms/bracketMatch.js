//bracket match

/*Given a string that consists of brackets, write a function bracketMatch that takes a bracket string as an input and returns the minimum number of brackets youâ€™d need to add to the input in order to make it correctly matched.
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of text. We go through every character of text and for every character we carry out a constant number of steps.

Space Complexity: O(1) since we only used a constant amount of space throughout the algorithm.
